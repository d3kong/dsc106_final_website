      <h2>Meet the High-Risk Patient</h2>
      <p>
        A 68-year-old arrives with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), long-standing heart disease, and 
        uncontrolled diabetes. Their anesthesiologist assigns an <strong>ASA score 4</strong>—a designation meaning 
        “severe systemic disease that is a constant threat to life.”  
        As the family waits in the pre-op room, the surgeon, nurse, and anesthesiologist gather. Each decision— 
        from timing to technique—carries extra weight.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is our focal patient. In their case, “routine” can become anything but routine.  
        Which surgeries remain feasible? Which must be postponed or carefully planned?  
        Over the next few sections, we’ll reveal how historical data can guide these life-and-death decisions.

    <!-- ─── Story Part 2: Identifying Risk ─── -->
    <section class="visualization-section story-section">
      <h2>Identifying Risk Through Past Patients</h2>
      <p>
        By examining thousands of past cases, we identify patterns that correlate with surgical mortality risk.  
        We sort procedures into low-, medium-, and high-risk categories—then ask:  
        “Which surgeries carry the greatest danger for someone exactly like our ASA 4 patient?”  
        Recognizing the demographic and clinical patterns common in high-risk patients empowers clinicians to 
        tailor consultations and set realistic expectations.

    <!-- ─── Story Part 3: Perception Matters ─── -->
    <section class="visualization-section story-section">
      <h2>Perception Matters: Pre-Op Stress Signals</h2>
      <p>
        Even “simple” procedures can trigger immense stress—especially when ASA 4 looms large.  
        In our heatmap (coming next), we’ll track how combinations of risk factors (age, ASA, comorbidities) 
        amplify pre-operative “stress.”  
        This emotional layer can affect consent, compliance, and ultimately outcomes. Anticipating when a patient 
        needs extra reassurance or in-depth explanation is just as crucial as understanding raw mortality statistics.
      </p>

    <!-- ─── Story Part 4: Planning the Conversation ─── -->
    <section class="visualization-section story-section">
      <h2>Planning the Conversation</h2>
      <p>
        Once we know which surgeries are risky and where red flags accumulate, the next step is communication.  
        How do you speak to this ASA 4 patient in a way that’s honest yet empathetic?  
        The radar chart you’ll see soon will suggest how to balance medical detail, emotional support, and decision-making 
        urgency—based on demographics and risk factors.

    <!-- ─── Story Part 5: Conclusion & Call-to-Action ─── -->
    <section class="visualization-section story-section">
      <h2>Conclusion: Data Makes Surgical Care More Human</h2>
      <p>
        Before any incision, data can illuminate the path: predicting risk, anticipating stressors, and shaping 
        tailored conversations. Our ASA 4 patient is not just a statistic—but an individual whose journey can be 
        made more transparent, informed, and humane.
