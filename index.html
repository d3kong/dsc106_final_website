    <!-- ─── Story Part 1: ASA 4 Patient Introduction ─── -->
    <section id="story-asa4" class="visualization-section story-section">
      <h2>Meet the High-Risk Patient</h2>
      <p>
        Meet Daniel, a 68-year-old man facing a difficult question: Should he undergo exploratory laparotomy—a surgery often used to diagnose or address abdominal emergencies? With long-standing heart disease, uncontrolled diabetes, and COPD, Daniel has been classified as ASA 4, meaning he lives with a constant threat to life from systemic illness.</p>
        
        <p>This ASA score isn’t just a label—it’s a signal that routine surgeries can become dangerous quickly. The same procedure might look completely different for someone healthier. So how do we decide what’s safe, and how to move forward?
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- ─── Story Part 2: Identifying Risk ─── -->
    <section class="visualization-section story-section">
      <h2>Identifying Risk Through Past Patients</h2>
      <p>
        By examining thousands of past cases, we identify patterns that correlate with surgical blood loss.  
        We sort procedures into regions, each with a low-risk and high-risk surgery, then ask:  
        “Which surgeries carry the greatest danger for someone exactly like our ASA 4 patient?”  
        Recognizing the demographic and clinical patterns common in high-risk patients empowers clinicians to 
        tailor consultations and set realistic expectations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- ─── Story Part 3: Perception Matters ─── -->
    <section class="visualization-section story-section">
      <h2>Perception Matters: Pre-Op Stress Signals</h2>
      <p>
        Even “simple” procedures can trigger immense stress—especially when ASA 4 looms large.  
        In our heatmap (coming next), we’ll track how ASA levels can affect mortality rates.  
        This emotional layer can affect consent, compliance, and ultimately outcomes. Anticipating when a patient 
        needs extra reassurance or in-depth explanation is just as crucial as understanding raw mortality statistics.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- ─── Story Part 4: Planning the Conversation ─── -->
    <section class="visualization-section story-section">
      <h2>Planning the Conversation</h2>
      <p>
        Once we know which surgeries are risky and where red flags accumulate, the next step is communication.  
        How do you speak to this ASA 4 patient in a way that’s honest yet empathetic?  
        The radar chart you’ll see soon will suggest how to balance medical detail, emotional support, and decision-making 
        urgency—based on demographics and risk factors.
      </p>
    </section>

    <!-- ─── Story Part 5: Conclusion & Call-to-Action ─── -->
    <section class="visualization-section story-section">
      <h2>Conclusion: Data Makes Surgical Care More Human</h2>
      <p>
        Before any incision, data can illuminate the path: predicting risk, anticipating stressors, and shaping 
        tailored conversations. Our ASA 4 patient is not just a statistic—but an individual whose journey can be 
        made more transparent, informed, and humane.
