        <h2>Surgeries Can Be Stressful</h2>
        <p>Surgeries can be stressful—for both you and your patients.</p>
        <p>
          Even the most routine procedures carry their own risks, and some operations, by their very nature,
          are significantly more complex or hazardous than others. Knowing what to expect and preparing
          accordingly can make all the difference.

        <h2>Identifying Risk Through Past Patients</h2>
        <p>
          Identifying trends in past patients that could be correlated to surgical mortality risk can optimize
          preoperative decision-making and communication of potential risk to patients. Sorting different types
          of operations into low, medium, and high risk categories helps predict potential complications and
          prepares clinicians to face them.
        </p>
        <p>
          Recognizing the demographics and patterns in clinical metrics that are often present in high-risk
          patients can allow health professionals to tailor consultations to a specific patient, making it simpler
          for them to explain to their patients what should be expected before, during, and after surgery,
          allowing for increased transparency.

          You can start by selecting the metric that you’d like to explore further such as Age, ASA Score, or BMI.
          You can then click on a legend item and/or axis label to filter the data and explore even deeper.
          Once you select, you will see descriptive text with statistical summaries and key factors to be considered.

        <h2>Perception Matters: Anxiety Heatmap</h2>
        <p>
          Some procedures may appear simple on paper—but perception matters.
          Your patients walk in with questions—and some, with fear. Anxiety levels can rise dramatically based
          on how rare a procedure is, or how closely it’s associated with mortality.
        </p>
        <p>
          This heatmap visualizes that emotional layer. It shows how common a procedure is, how often it results
          in death, and where patients tend to feel the most fear. It’s a reminder that part of your job isn’t just
          explaining the science—it’s reading the room. Anticipating when a patient might need reassurance,
          explanation, or space to process. Here, you can see where that’s most likely to happen.

        <h2>Planning the Conversation</h2>
        <p>
          Now that you’ve reviewed the risks and psychological impact, you’re ready to plan for the conversation that
          matters most. For each surgery type, we’ve collected the most common preparation steps: anesthesia method,
          IV location, and admission timing. These are summaries from real-world cases—what patients like yours
          most often experience.

          Input your patient's age, sex, height, and weight. You’ll receive a tailored profile showing what’s typical
          in terms of lab results and surgical prep. It’s everything you need to guide the conversation—accurate,
          concise, and patient-specific.

        <h2>Conclusion: Data Makes Surgical Care More Human</h2>
        <p>
          Surgical care begins long before the incision. By using data to predict risk, anticipate anxiety,
          and prepare tailored guidance, you’re helping your patient face their operation not with fear—but
          with clarity. This isn't just about outcomes. It's about making the journey to the operating room
          more transparent, more informed, and more human.
